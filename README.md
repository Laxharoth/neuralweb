# Simple Neural Network in C++

This repository contains a basic implementation of a feedforward neural network written in C++. The network learns using only the backpropagation algorithm. This project was created as a learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of neural networks and to practice C++.

## Features

* **Feedforward Neural Network:** Implements a multi-layer perceptron.
* **Backpropagation:** The sole learning algorithm used for training.
* **C++:** Written from scratch in standard C++.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Laxharoth/neuralweb.git
    cd neuralweb
    ```

## Disclaimer

I created this program when I wasn't as experienced in the use of C++ nor in the structure of neural networks. It is not suitable for complex real-world applications due to its basic nature and potential lack of optimizations.

## Contributing

As this was primarily a personal learning project, contributions are not actively sought at this time.
